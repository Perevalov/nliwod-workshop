#### [Ricardo Usbeck](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/people/ricardo-usbeck.html) (M) 

Prof. Ricardo Usbeck received his PhD in Computer Science in 2017 at Leipzig University, Germany. He then joined Paderborn University and Fraunhofer IAIS as team leader, each for two years. Since 2021, he is junior professor for semantic systems at Hamburg University. He and his team are developing and benchmarking industrial and academic question answering systems and are exploring hybrid dialogue-based systems. 
He was the chair of the successfully concluded W3C community group for natural language interfaces as well as organizer of the 7th, 8th, and 9th QALD challenges at ESWC 2017 and ISWC 2017, as well as ISWC 2018 and 2020. He is the main contact person.

#### [Meriem Beloucif](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/meriem-beloucif.html) (F) 
Dr. Meriem Beloucif obtained her PhD degree at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). After her PhD, Meriem worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen under the supervision of Prof. Søgaard. Currently, her research focuses Comparative Question Answering with Prof. Biemann at Hamburg University as part of the ACQUA project. Her work aims at using the information in knowledge bases to accurately answer comparative questions, hence overcoming the poor coverage of rare entities when using Web data and knowledge bases. Meriem is one of the organizers of Touché @CLEF (2020, 2021, 2022) and one of the co-founders of North Africans D&I group at different Computational Linguistics conferences.

#### [Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) (M) 
Prof. Chris Biemann obtained his doctorate in Computer Science / Natural Language Processing in 2007 from the University of Leipzig, before joining the San Francisco-based semantic search startup Powerset, which was acquired by Microsoft to form the Bing.com search engine. In 2011, he got appointed as assistant professor for language technology in the computer science department at TU Darmstadt; since October 2016, Chris is professor for language technology at the University of Hamburg in Germany. His current research is focused on adaptive natural language processing, Web-scale statistical semantic methods, machine learning from crowdsourcing signals and on applications in the humanities and social sciences. Chris has organized multiple workshops and shared tasks before, including GermEval (2014-2020), SemEval(2013) and CLEF(2019,2020). 

#### [Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo](http://dice-research.org) (M) 
Prof. Axel Ngonga heads the DICE and AKSW research groups in Paderborn and Leipzig, where he works on topics such as Information Extraction, Question Answering and Keyword-Based Search with a strong focus on structured data. Axel has co-organized the QALD workshops as well as the BioASQ challenges. He has participated in the creation of the corresponding benchmark datasets and also co-organized the OKBQA Hackathon. He has lead the HOBBIT H2020 project on benchmarking Linked Data as well as the DIESEL and QAMEL projects on distributed search and question answering on mobile devices. Axel has served on the senior program/organizing committees of (Semantic)Web and AI confer-ences including ESWC, ISWC, WWW, LREC, and AAAI.
